# Roadmap Proposal to Humanity Unchained DAO

Version 1.0 / 2022-07-24

This document is a roadmap proposal to the community of [Humanity Unchained DAO](https://humanityunchained.org). HUD is a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) running a on-chain semi-direct democracy on the Polygon network using [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id) as an identity registry.

We based our proposal on various resources, being [Balaji Srinivasan's new book "The Network State"](https://thenetworkstate.org) one of the best available.
We strongly recommend to read it for those who want to understand the principles, goals and roadmap of [Humanity Unchained DAO (HUD)](https://humanityunchained.org).

We would like to present the following proposal to the community.

## Goal

We define the **New Free World (NFW)** as a world in which human beings can freely choose the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) they wish to live in, and even create new ones.

In such a world, every human being has not only the right but also the ability to opt out from the state he/she was imposed at birth and opt in to other social contracts among many available. In the *NFW*, a global liquid market of [network states](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-sentence) (as Balaji describes in his book) that implement *smart social contracts* has emerged. Thus social contracts compete for citizens' loyalty to survive. The consolidation of this new social paradigm indirectly solves a great deal of the long-standing problems of humanity related to war, corruption and poverty.

Our goal is:

> To accelerate the transition to the New Free World (NFW) by building the first network state at global scale, so it can be replicated and improved by others. For that, this state will use [Humanity Unchained DAO (HUD)](https://humanityunchained.org) as the technology tool needed for its development.
>
> We strongly believe we need to achieve the NFW urgently before humanity crosses the *point of no return* that will trap humanity in a technocratic dystopia.

## Implementation

Any organization needs some type of structure to operate. Therefore, we need a reliable tool that allows us to organize a community of millions of human beings in a decentralized way. For that, we propose to use a special type of NFT so that the HUD community can democratically assign roles to citizens and create task forces. The DAO may decide what roles are needed and who among the citizens fill them, based on whatever criteria the DAO considers appropriate, not necesseraly economic-based ones (such as the current *tokencracies*) nor self-imposed ones through an algorithm. These criteria could be, for example, reputation, trustworthiness, merit, professionalism and commitment to the DAO's goal. We call this type of NFT `emblems`.

`emblems` have the following characteristics:

- Only the DAO can mint, burn and transfer them
- Only citizens of the DAO can receive the token.
- The receivers cannot transfer the token, not even to another citizen, but they can always refuse to hold it by returning it to the DAO.
- The DAO can take back the token from the holder.

We can use `emblems` to organize the DAO in many ways. To begin with, we propose to mint `emblems` of two types: `guilds` and `projects`.

`Guilds` are groups of citizens who share a common skillset. `Projects` are groups of citizens who share a common task or project. Citizens holding a `project emblem` are responsible for that project: they take the decisions, plan, organize their teams, manage their available resources, and report any updates to the rest of HUD (for example, in the community calls).

For example: project `P` may needs 3 *full-time* citizens of guild `G1`, 2 citizens of guild `G2` and 1 citizen of guild `G3`.

Note that a citizen can belong to several `guilds` and `projects` at the same time.

There is a limited number of tokens per `emblem`, as the DAO decides to mint or burn according to its needs at that time. The DAO shall decide wisely on who assign the tokens to, as each `emblem` carries their corresponding duties and responsibilities. As such, they are a binding contract between the DAO and the citizen. Should the citizen neglect his responsibilities towards the DAO, the DAO can take the `emblem` and the reputation of the citizen would unavoidably damage.

The result of using `emblems` this way is a flat type of structure in which the whole DAO, not a small group of individuals, is fully sovereign to assign or unassign any roles and tasks to any member of the DAO at any time. We foresee the use of `emblems` to grant certain permissions to perform specific tasks on a smart contract level in HUD.


### Guilds

We propose the following guilds to start with:

|Name|Role and responsibilities|
| --- | --- |
|Mods|They are in charge of the moderation of the social channels (e.g. the Telegram groups). They answer questions from the community, spread news and updates and overall contribute to create a good atmosphere. |
|Devs|They are responsible for building and mantaining the tech infrastructure, such as smart contracts, dapps, servers, websites, code repositories, ENS, backlog for new features and bug fixes, etc. They also play an important role in educating the community in cybersecurity topics.|
|Legals|They are the link between the *legacy world* and the New Free World. They advice the community in legal matters. For example: If the DAO wants to own assets available only in the legacy world (e.g. a piece of land, a building, etc.), legals would create the legal structures to do it in the best way possible.|
|Medias|They are the DAO's spokepersons. They are responsible for all the DAO's official communications through social networks and old media. They are in charge of spreading HUD news through different channels and in different languages, creating contents in different formats, communication strategy, advertisement, etc. |


### Projects

We propose the following *projects* to start with:

|Name|Summary|
| --- | --- |
|[Genesis Tokens](projects/GenesisTokens/README.md)| A way to commemorate the birth of Humanity Unchained DAO by selling a limited number of tokens on an auction. The value of the tokens may, in principle, be solely honorific and/or artistic. We also propose to allocate part of the funds in the [UBI Burning Vault](http://app.democracy.earth/). The DAO shall decide the percentage.|
|[Emmental](projects/Emmental/README.md)| The goal of the **Emmental Project** is to create a geographical concentration of [Humanity Unchained DAO](https://humanityunchained.org) citizens in specific regions all over the world, through exercising their legal right to move freely within the boards of their legacy states, to achieve a democratic majority that supports the principles of the HUD. This idea is inspired by the [Free State Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project).|
|[Identity Registry](projects/IdentityRegistry/README.md)| A identity registry system based on [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id) that takes the most of HUD to create a better identity system in terms of governance, scalability and cost. |
|[Staking](projects/Staking/README.md)| HUD token holders would receive reputational tokens that may be used by the DAO as an additional criteria for citizens to opt certain roles or execute certain tasks. |


### How to create or get an `emblem`

Creating a `guild` implies that the DAO acknowledges the need for a certain skill, specialization or role inside the DAO in order to achieve the goal. Creating a `project` implies that the DAO acknowledges the need to start a new project or task, and to allocate resources for it.

If a citizen wants to join a `guild` or a `project`, he or she needs to publicly, he or she must announce it publicly to the community and go through screen process that the DAO requires. In other words, the candidate needs to convince the DAO.

In any case, the DAO will need to democratically approve a transaction to create or transfer the `emblem` token. As for every voting, it is recommended to first propose your idea to the community in the [forum](https://forum.humanityunchained.org/), so it can be later voted off-chain and, lastly, voted on-chain.


### Example of on-chain voting

On-chain votings shall be performed on a weekly basis on certain days, as long as there are pending votings. The following is an example:

|Voting|Transaction|Purpose|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|1| Update the PoH oracle.|
| |2| Fix a bug in one of the smart contracts.|
| |3| Transfer tokens from the DAO's wallet to pay members or third-parties.|
| |4| Change a parameter of one of the smart contracts.|
| |5| Assign emblems of type `guild` to the candidates selected via off-line voting.|
| |6| Create a new `emblem` of type `project` to start a new project.|
| |7| Assign the new `project` to the candidates selected via off-line voting.
|2|1| Expel a member of the DAO due to dishonest behavior towards the community.|

As a general rule, transactions likely to be approved should be grouped in the same voting. The goal is to minimize the risk of having to repeat a voting again. Off-chain voting may serve as a fair predictor of whether the transaction will be approved on-chain. Transactions whith an unclear forecast (i.e. expeling a member of the DAO might be a controversial issue that divides the community in half) will be voted separatedly.


## Other technical improvements

You can see HUD's GitHub issues [here](https://github.com/hhh01398/hud/issues). The issue [#16 Support multiple transactions in a single voting](https://github.com/hhh01398/hud/issues/16) is paramount to move forward faster by lowering the number of votings needed.


## Schedule

The following is an orientative schedule. Community Calls will be hold on the Telegram groups. Off-chain voting will be done in [HUD's Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/humanityunchaineddao.eth).

|Event|Details|
| --- | --- |
|Community Call (English)| Friday @ 9PM CET|
|Community Call (Spanish)| Thursday @ 11PM CET|
|Off-chain votings start| Any day|
|Off-chain votings end| Next week's Thursday|
|On-chain voting start| Saturday|
|On-chain voting ends| Monday|

**Note**: Change on the schedule may be announced on short notice, so stay tuned for any updates in the Telegram groups.


## Calendar

**Note**: The following calendar is an estimate. We may be forced to change it on short notice because of diverse reasons such as time constrains and limited resources.
