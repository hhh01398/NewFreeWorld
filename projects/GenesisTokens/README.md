# Genesis Tokens

This document is a proposal to the community of [Humanity Unchained DAO](https://humanityunchained.org) to create an NFT. This would be the first NFT ever created democratically by a DAO in a purely decentralized fashion (that is, without trusting a middleman).

We propose the HUD community to start a debate around the following questions:

- **Purpose**: What is the purpose or purposes of the token? If funds are risen, what would the DAO do with them?

- **Image**: What is the token image? Let's create something beautiful and memorable.

- **Message**: What message do we want to send to humanity with this token?

- **Utility**: Should the token have any use? If so, what would that use be?


## Purpose

In our view, the creation of the tokens could have the several purposes, such as:

1. Commemorate the birth of Humanity Unchained DAO.

2. Raise funds to enable HUD to move forward towards its goal of creating a *network state*.

3. Serve as advertisement tool to spark the attention of potential future HUD citizens in the social networks.

4. Allocate a part (to be decided by HUD) of the funds to [UBI Burning Vault](http://app.democracy.earth/).


## Details

We propose to auction a total of 100 tokens on Opensea over the Polygon network. The action could be 3 months long. Funds would be directly collected in the HUD's wallet. The token would implement the ERC-1155 standard based on OpenZeppelin templates.
