# Emmental Project

> Draft 0.1 / 2022-07-24

The goal of the **Emmental Project** is to create a geographical concentration of [Humanity Unchained DAO (HUD)](https://humanityunchained.org) citizens in specific regions across the world, by exercising the right of citizens to move freely within the borders of a state, in order to achieve a democratic majority in alignment with the principles of the DAO in those regions. This idea is inspired by the [Free State Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project).

The name *"Emmental"* is after the famous Swiss cheese with holes, as that is how the political map of the world would look like if the project becomes successful. The holes would represent the regions with a majority of HUD members, which we call *clusters*.

# Phases

The following phases are proposed:

|Phase|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Selection| The community debates on what criteria use to select the regions. The following criteria could be used:<br /><br /> - **Legislation:** Laws in the region must allow citizens to move freely and the posibility to change the laws and regulations of the region through democratic means.<br /><br /> - **Political sentiment:** The closer to HUD ideas the political sentiment of the region is, the easier it will be to create a new political majority.<br /><br /> - **Population:** Changing the political sentiment of a region is more plausible if the initial number of inhabitants in the region is lower.<br /><br /> - **Economy:** The region's economy should be expanding, both in terms of job offers and accommodation, in order to better absorb the influx of immigrants.<br /><br /> - **Natural resources:** The region must have natural resources (rivers, minerals, arable land, etc.) and explotation systems (dams, mines, crops, etc.) so the region can be as much self-sufficient as possible.<br /><br /> - **Infrastructures:** The region should be connected with other regions by land, water and air.
|Signaling| HUD members who want to move permanently to one of the selected areas must share it with the community in the first place. |
|Deposit| Once a minimum number of HUD members is reached for a region, the members must make a deposit in a smart contract created for such purpose. The funds will be unlocked on the condition that the member finally moves. |
|Moving| The HUD members move to the region. A proof of location should be provided in order to unlock the deposited funds. |
|Settlement| The HUD members live in the new region and join the political affairs there with the goal to build a democratic majority that supports the principles of HUD. |
