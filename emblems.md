# Emblems

> Draft 0.2 / 2022-08-24

Any organization needs some type of structure to operate. Therefore, we need a reliable tool that allows us to organize a community of millions of human beings in a decentralized way. For that, we propose to use a special type of NFT so that the HUD community can democratically assign roles to citizens and create task forces. The DAO may decide what roles are needed and who among the citizens fill them, based on whatever criteria the DAO considers appropriate, not necesseraly economic-based ones (such as the current *tokencracies*) nor self-imposed ones through an algorithm. These criteria could be, for example, reputation, trustworthiness, merit, professionalism and commitment to the DAO's goal. We call this type of NFT `emblems`.

`emblems` have the following characteristics:

- Only the DAO can mint, burn and transfer them
- Only citizens of the DAO can receive the token.
- The receivers cannot transfer the token, not even to another citizen, but they can always refuse to hold it by returning it to the DAO.
- The DAO can take back the token from the holder.

We can use `emblems` to organize the DAO in many ways. To begin with, we propose to mint `emblems` of two types: `guilds` and `projects`.

`Guilds` are groups of citizens who share a common skillset. `Projects` are groups of citizens who share a common task or project. Citizens holding a `project emblem` are responsible for that project: they take the decisions, plan, organize their teams, manage their available resources, and report any updates to the rest of HUD (for example, in the community calls).

For example: project `P` may needs 3 *full-time* citizens of guild `G1`, 2 citizens of guild `G2` and 1 citizen of guild `G3`.

Note that a citizen can belong to several `guilds` and `projects` at the same time.

There is a limited number of tokens per `emblem`, as the DAO decides to mint or burn according to its needs at that time. The DAO shall decide wisely on who assign the tokens to, as each `emblem` carries their corresponding duties and responsibilities. As such, they are a binding contract between the DAO and the citizen. Should the citizen neglect his responsibilities towards the DAO, the DAO can take the `emblem` and the reputation of the citizen would unavoidably damage.

The result of using `emblems` this way is a flat type of structure in which the whole DAO, not a small group of individuals, is fully sovereign to assign or unassign any roles and tasks to any member of the DAO at any time. We foresee the use of `emblems` to grant certain permissions to perform specific tasks on a smart contract level in HUD.


### Guilds

An example of guilds could be this:

|Name|Image|Role and responsibilities|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Mods|<img src="assets/img/mods.png" width="200px"/>|They are in charge of the moderation of the social channels (e.g. the Telegram groups). They answer questions from the community, spread news and updates and overall contribute to create a good atmosphere. |
|Artists|<img src="assets/img/artists.png" width="200px"/>|Crean el artwork de los tokens. Inspiran a la comunidad con sus creaciones. Contribuyen al dise√±o de interfaces atractivas para el usuario.|
|Devs|<img src="assets/img/devs.png" width="200px"/>|They are responsible for building and mantaining the tech infrastructure, such as smart contracts, dapps, servers, websites, code repositories, ENS, backlog for new features and bug fixes, etc. They also play an important role in educating the community in cybersecurity topics.|
|Legals|<img src="assets/img/legals.png" width="200px"/>|They are the link between the *legacy world* and the New Free World. They advice the community in legal matters. For example: If the DAO wants to own assets available only in the legacy world (e.g. a piece of land, a building, etc.), legals would create the legal structures to do it in the best way possible.|
|Medias|<img src="assets/img/medias.png" width="200px"/>|They are the DAO's spokepersons. They are responsible for all the DAO's official communications through social networks and old media. They are in charge of spreading HUD news through different channels and in different languages, creating contents in different formats, communication strategy, advertisement, etc. |


### How to create or get an `emblem`

Creating a `guild` implies that the DAO acknowledges the need for a certain skill, specialization or role inside the DAO in order to achieve the goal. Creating a `project` implies that the DAO acknowledges the need to start a new project or task, and to allocate resources for it.

If a citizen wants to join a `guild` or a `project`, he or she needs to publicly, he or she must announce it publicly to the community and go through screen process that the DAO requires. In other words, the candidate needs to convince the DAO.

In any case, the DAO will need to democratically approve a transaction to create or transfer the `emblem` token. As for every voting, it is recommended to first propose your idea to the community in the [forum](https://forum.humanityunchained.org/), so it can be later voted off-chain and, lastly, voted on-chain.
